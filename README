deb2targz is a tool to help create Slackware packages from Debian's .deb
packages. Converted binary packages can then be installed/removed using the
'installpkg/removepkg' commands, or 'pkgtool'.

It's advisable to at least examine the converted package with 'less' to make
sure it won't do anything too crazy to your system. Packages you install are
your responsibility. Use rpm2targz at your own risk.

Another tool to do this can be found at https://code.google.com/p/deb2tgz/
though this does not attempt to extraxt package metadata.
